# Newborn Weight Prediction and Interpretation Utilizing Explainable Machine Learning

## Overview

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks created by **Safiul Haque Chowdhury** as part of a research project presented in the paper titled **"Newborn Weight Prediction and Interpretation Utilizing Explainable Machine Learning."** The project was conducted from **November 22 to November 28, 2023**, in the **Lab Basement 4 at Bangladesh University**. The notebooks implement various regression models and data analysis techniques, leveraging Explainable AI (XAI) to interpret the predictions.

## Contents

This repository includes the following models and methods:
- **Regression Models** for newborn weight prediction
- **Explainable AI (XAI)** techniques for model interpretability
- **Dimensionality Reduction** methods:
  - Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
